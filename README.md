# npm-inlearning

## What

This is my repo for working through the inLearning NPM course.

## Why

I will use this repo to test the code in the course and to keep track of the things I learn. I will focus on documentation as I go and end with a repo that I can look back at when I have any questions about NPM.

### Notes

1. Set up a simple express server.

2. Initialize package.json with our test package.

Install express using terminal and npm install express. Notice that express was added as a dependency in the package.json file and that a new nodule_modules folder has appeared. Packages can be installed locally or globally. Locally installs the package only in the working directory.

3. Install babel using npm install babel-cli babel-preset-stage-0 babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev

This installs babel as a dev dependency only and is not included in the build of the app.

4. Install react globally

This installs react globally on your system.

5. Install create react app globally

See above^ For windows 7+ globally installed packages live in your AppData folder.
